# Main Menu Audio Replacer
Allows to switch main menu music.

Similar to Dynamic Resolution Extended, this mod also features a settings entry within the settings menu.

Huge thanks to algernon for input, as always check out his other creations!

What is this? This mod allows to switch main menu music!

This mod utilizes algernon's Localization framework and you're more than welcome to contact me/make push request with additional changes.

# Usage


Find 'Main Menu Theme Replacer' section in the settings menu.

Within here you will find several checkboxes to select your theme or alternatively you can import your own! You need to do this manually at this time.

Refer to how to do this below.



The other options are within the Advanced tab, to show them, click 'Show Advanced'

This mod has been labelled as TEST and it's obviously not the final release. 
# NOTE
This build has 3 premade audio themes including:

- Original soundtrack from Cities Skylines 1
- SimCity soundtrack from SimCity 5
- Resident Evil soundtrack

Let me know if you want more themes bundled with the mod.

# How to import your own theme soundtrack

First of all head to this location:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cities Skylines II\Cities2_Data\StreamingAssets\Audio~\MainMenu.ogg

If your install is different from C: simply switch that to your location instead, this also means the mod becomes useless when the game is not installed on the C: drive but you can import your own anyway.

Get your theme audio ready and in format .ogg then with MP3TAG or a similar program put as a title "Main Menu Theme", if you wish rename this file "MainMenu.ogg" but I don't believe it is crucial to do so.

Failure to place the Title tag will result in an exception due to the game referring to tags to find assets.

I'm working on a solution to do this automatically with the mod.


I, Nyoko have constructed this code, drawing from Algernon's 529 Lites code as its foundation.

Explicit prohibition against redistributing any monetary aspects. This mod can also be found at SkyLinx, display only.
